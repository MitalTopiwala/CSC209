Please see the website for the marking scheme for the midterm exam. Note that although the midterm has 35 marks in total, we have instead marked it out of 33 (so, e.g., if you have a 33/35, that will be graded as 100%).

We anticipate that some of you will ask for regrading: Monday March 25 is the final day to submit a regrade request.

How to submit for regrading:
1/  Print out your entire test.  On a separate page indicate the question where the marking error occurred.  Cite the marking scheme when possible.

2/  Bring it to Professor Vrbik in DH 3072.

3/  Grades will be changed by March 31.

Some words regarding regrading:
1/  Marking errors go both ways.  You may have lost a mark unfairly, but it is just as likely you gained one the same way.  Carefully look at your own solutions to ensure they are indeed correct before submitting a regrade request.

2/  It is possible that your mark will *go down* when it is looked at by the instructors.  This is because the *entire test* is regraded, out of fairness for all students in the class - our aim is to be fully consistent with the marking scheme for *all* students, to avoid giving any unfair advantages or disadvantages.

3/  We did not award fractional marks on this test (i.e., no half marks) - instead, we scaled up the total number of marks to make half-marks unnecessary. This has helped to ensure consistency and minimize error when grading.

The exception to the above-mentioned points (1 and 2) is if there was an arithmetic error made when adding up your marks.  In that case, we will correct your grade without remarking your test.
